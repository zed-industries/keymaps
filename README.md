# keymaps

This repository contains keymaps that aim to replicate the feel of other editors.

## Changing keymaps

Zed refers to this keymap layer as `base keymaps`.  To change your base keymap, open the command palette via `cmd-shift-p` and then search for `welcome: toggle base keymap selector`.  Choosing one of these options will update the `base_keymap` setting in your `settings.json` file.  Currently, we manually update these keymaps within zed to match the contents of those within this repository, but in the future, we will improve this process.

## Issues and pull requests

Issues for the `keymaps` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zed-industries/community/labels/keymap%20%2F%20keybinding).

Feel free to open a pull request to:
- Fix an issue for an existing keymap
- Add a new keymap

## Things to note

- Some functionality may be missing in these keymaps, as Zed may not currently support the action or may not have a way to represent it with a customizable keybinding
- Keymaps are not one of our main priorities at this time, but we will add and update them as we are able. We welcome pull requests to help with this effort.
